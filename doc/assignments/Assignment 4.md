In this assignment, you graduate to full on data-wrangler. A customer provided me (your very unhelpful boss), with "all of the data you will need to understand why the server went down." Now I'm passing it off to you to figure out!

The customer's web server blew up and they had some very weird logging solution. They think they were attacked and we will see a strange pattern in the data if we can just fix it and visualize it.

For this assignment, please submit a matplotlib or plotly line graph, visualizing what happened to our client's web server.
